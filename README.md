# ev-servers

This is the code from an app I wrote several years ago, flaws and all, using jQuery and other libraries.

Belimo Energy Valves have built-in web servers used to adjust their settings and otherwise monitor their status. 
This is a very simple app I wrote fresh out of college to make my job of managing those servers easier.

If I were going to revisit this and improve it, I'd use more modern JS, turn that plain text server list into a proper 
database and improve my jswindows file, which I used to manage servers without leaving the app.
